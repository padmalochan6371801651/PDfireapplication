                <p>The Puri Jagannath Temple, located in the coastal town of Puri, Odisha, is one of the most revered
                    Hindu temples in India. Dedicated to Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the temple is
                    part of the Char Dham pilgrimage, which also includes Badrinath, Dwarka, and Rameswaram.

                    Built in the 12th century by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, the temple's architecture is a prime
                    example of the Kalinga style. The towering Shikhar (Vimana) of the temple stands at 65 meters and is
                    visible from miles away. The main deities worshipped in the temple are Lord Jagannath, his brother
                    Balabhadra, and sister Subhadra. These deities are uniquely represented in wooden forms, unlike the
                    typical stone idols seen in most temples.

                    The temple is renowned for its annual Rath Yatra (Chariot Festival), where the deities are carried
                    out of the temple on massive chariots, attracting millions of devotees worldwide. Non-Hindus are not
                    permitted to enter the temple, but they can view it from a nearby platform. The Jagannath Temple is
                    also known for its massive kitchen, which prepares the famous Mahaprasad, served to thousands of
                    devotees daily, symbolizing community and devotion.

            <p id="jaga">Jagannath is a revered deity in Hinduism, worshiped primarily in the city of Puri, Odisha, at the famous Jagannath Temple. Lord Jagannath is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and more specifically an incarnation of Lord Krishna. He is depicted with large round eyes and a smiling face, representing compassion and love.
